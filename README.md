# the-react-redux-express

Install the package globally with `npm install -g the-react-redux-express`

To use, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you'd like to create the new repo.

To create a repo with examples on how to use React, Redux, and redux observables, run: 
```create-app app-name --ts --examples```

To create a clean, empty TS repo with React and Redux already set up, run:
```create-app app-name --ts```

A JS repo can be created by running `create-app app-name`, however this repo is no longer maintained. 

`app-name` must follow NPM naming conventions, which can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json).
